These are set of python files which include all the techniques tested for clarity prediction.
The methods tested include - 
1. stutter approach (stutter_approach.py, stap2.py, stap3.py)
2. term frequency of commonly used words (only_filler_words.py,only_filler_words2.py)
3. term frequency of commonly used words stacking model (clarity_stacked.py)
4. hybrid of stutter method and commonly used words method (combined_approach.py, combined_approach2.py)

The dataset is confidential hence will not be included in the repository.
